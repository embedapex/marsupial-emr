# What is Marsupial? (https://www.marsupialemr.com)
Marsupial is a free electronic medical record solution for healthcare educators. Marsupial provides students and educators in nursing and other healthcare disciplines the ability to augment their labs and simulations with realistic charting and medication administration experiences.
# Contribute
Marsupial is free to use for anyone, but has taken significant time to create and support. It was made with the intent to provide an alternative to for-profit education. Please consider donating to help offset some of the costs of hosting and developing the software.<br/><br/>
